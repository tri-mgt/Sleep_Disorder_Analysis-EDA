# EDA: Sleep Disorder Analysis

## Objective:

The main goal is to investigate the factors contributing to sleep disorder, including occupation, age, gender, sleep duration, and daily steps.

## Hypothesis:

Healthcare workers are likely to experience sleep disorder compared to non-healthcare workers. Thus, they have low quality of sleep, short sleep durations, and a higher prevalence of sleep disorder.

## Analysis breakdown:

**Occupation vs. Sleep Disorder**

1. Which profession suffer the most from sleep disorder?
2. How much sleep does each professional get?
3. What is their stress level?

**Gender vs. Sleep Disorder**
1. .Gender Count
2. Which gender experiences sleep disorder the most frequently?

**Age vs. Sleep Disorder**
1. What is the average age at which people experience sleep disorder?

**Correlation Matrix**
1. Postive and negative correlation variable
2. Visualize it

**Daily Steps vs. Sleep Disorder**

Broken down into 2 groups:

  **Group 1:** Individuals who walked 7,000 and more

  **Group 2:** Individuals who walked less than 7,000 steps

  1. What is the quality of sleep and the sleep duration for each group?
  2. How many individuals have a sleep disorder?
  3. BMI Category


## Conclusion 
In conclusion, nurses were the most affected by sleep apnea, while salespeople and teachers frequently experience insomnia. Additionally, sleep disorders were more common among women (n=103) compared to men (n=52), with the average age at which sleep disorder typically begins is at 46 years old.
We also observed a negative correlation between stress level and both sleep duration and quality, indicating that the higher the stress levels associated with poorer sleep quality and duration. Conversely, higher sleep quality was linked to longer sleep duration.

In terms of daily steps, we divided the data into two groups: those who walked more than 7,000 steps per day and those who walked less. Group 1 demonstrated better sleep quality compared to Group 2. Moreover, the majority of individuals in Group 2 suffered from sleep disorders, with only a few reporting none. Additionally, we observed a correlation between BMI levels and sleep disorders, with a majority of individuals suffering from sleep disorders categorized as overweight.

Ultimately, to prevent sleep disorders, regular exercise routines such as walking can significantly benefit individuals' sleep quality and overall health.
